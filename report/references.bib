  abstract  = "The rotational positioning of DNA about the histone octamer
               appears to be determined by certain sequence-dependent
               modulations of DNA structure. To establish the detailed nature
               of these interactions, we have analysed the sequences of 177
               different DNA molecules from chicken erythrocyte core particles.
               All variations in the sequence content of these molecules, which
               may be attributed to sequence-dependent preferences for DNA
               bending, correlate well with the detailed path of the DNA as it
               wraps around the histone octamer in the crystal structure of the
               nucleosome core. The sequence-dependent preferences that
               correlate most closely with the rotational orientation of the
               DNA, relative to the surface of the protein, are of two kinds:
               ApApA/TpTpT and ApApT/ApTpT, the minor grooves of which face
               predominantly in towards the protein; and also GpGpC/GpCpC and
               ApGpC/GpCpT, whose minor grooves face outward. Fourier analysis
               has been used to obtain fractional variations in occurrence for
               all ten dinucleotide and all 32 trinucleotide arrangements.
               These sequence preferences should apply generally to many other
               cases of protein-DNA recognition, where the DNA wraps around a
               protein. In addition, it is observed that long runs of
               homopolymer (dA) X (dT) prefer to occupy the ends of core DNA,
               five to six turns away from the dyad. These same sequences are
               apparently excluded from the near-centre of core DNA, two to
               three turns from the dyad. Hence, the translational positioning
               of any single histone octamer along a DNA molecule of defined
               sequence may be strongly influenced by the placement of (dA) X
               (dT) sequences. It may also be influenced by any aversion of the
               protein for sequences in the ``linker'' region, the sequence
               content of which remains to be determined.",
